  In this project, we were provided with a new dataset titled 'Multi-mode Fault Diagnosis Datasets of Gearbox Under Variable Working Conditions', which is crucial for our gearbox fault detection analysis. 
  The dataset captures various operational parameters and sensor readings over time, which will help us investigate the performance of a gearbox under specific stress conditions.

  The dataset consists of the following key columns:
speed: The rotational speed of the gearbox shaft, likely measured in RPM.
torque: The torque applied to the gearbox, measured in Nm.
motor_vibration_x, motor_vibration_y, motor_vibration_z: Vibration signals recorded from the motor along the X, Y, and Z axes.
gearbox_vibration_x, gearbox_vibration_y, gearbox_vibration_z: Vibration signals recorded from the gearbox along the X, Y, and Z axes.

ðŸš§ Data Loading Issues
  When initially attempting to load the dataset into memory, we encountered some issues due to its size and the limitations of our computational environment. 
  The dataset was too large to load all at once, which caused memory allocation errors.

ðŸ’¡ Solution: Loading Data in Batches
To work around these memory limitations, we implemented a solution that involved loading the data in smaller, manageable batches. This approach allowed us to:
  Efficiently process the data without overwhelming the systemâ€™s memory capacity.
  Handle missing values and outliers incrementally, ensuring that each batch was properly cleaned before further analysis.

ðŸ”œ Next Steps
With the data successfully loaded and cleaned, the next phase of the project will involve:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the underlying patterns in the data.
Feature engineering to identify the most relevant variables for predicting gearbox faults.
